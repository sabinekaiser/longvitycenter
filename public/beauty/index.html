            Burn out is the result of prolonged excess physically and or
            psychologically. Many people - even young ones - fall into. This
            status of over-excetion presents itself for example in disturbed
            sleep, depressed mood with lack of emotions and just
            sterotypical functionating. To combat this excess we developed 
            fruitful strategies which can recover the physics and spirit.

            We life more then ever in a strong visual focused environment. This 
            exhaustes the visual sense together with other chronic disturbances.  We are cautioned by watching the
            increase of serious eye diseases in the last 20 years. This leads
            us to develop a prophylactic treatment course to replenish the physiological energy of our
            vision organs. If you are suffering from serious eye-diseases we can
            offer a complementary treatment procedure for regenerating your
            eyes by natural health sources.
