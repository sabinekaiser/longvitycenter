        Golden Eyes
      </h3>
      <p class="text-justify">
        We life more then ever in a strong visually focused environment. This 
        exhausts the visual sense. Additionally, from a holistic point of view 
        there are interactions between certain health complaints and the inner 
        nourishment of the eyes. We are alerted by noticing the increase of 
        serious eye diseases in the last decades. These reasons let us develop 
        a main focus called "Golden Eyes". We are convinced that the knowledge 
        of the Traditional Chinese Medicine regarding the inner nourishment of 
        the eyes is very useful in creating suitable therapy concepts. If you 
        are suffering from serious eye-diseases we can offer a complementary 
        treatment course.

        Burn-Out Syndrome
      </h3>
      <p class="text-justify">
        A burn out is the result of a prolonged physical and or psychological 
        strain. Many people - even young ones - succomb to it. This states of 
        over-exertion manifests itself, for example, in a disturbed sleep, a 
        depressed mood with a lack of emotions and just sterotyped functioning. 
        To combat this excess we developed efficient strategies which help to 
        recover one`s physical and mental balance. Enjoy this form of 
        regeneration.
